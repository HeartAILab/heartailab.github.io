## **HE**art **A**i **L**ab (**HEAL**)

HEAL is a team of researchers in the Division of Cardiology and Biomedical Informatics Center (BMIC) at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) dedicated to using artificial intelligence to improve the health of patients living with cardiovascular disease. Our focus is bridging the gap between the engineering sciences and cardiovascular care. We analyze unstructured data (imaging, clinical notes, ECG/waveforms), using innovative approaches to leverage deep learning in the diagnosis and management of heart failure. HEAL boasts an expanding program of both collaborative and internal research.
