Paul M. Heider, PhD, is an Assistant Professor in the Biomedical Informatics Center (BMIC) and the Department of Public Health Sciences (DPHS). Dr. Heider serves as head of the NLP Core, a service center for researchers who want to use natural language processing (NLP) tools to extract structured coded data from unstructured data sources like clinical notes. He has a background in computational linguistics and in the use of large-scale corpora for understanding the interplay between semantic representations and syntactic realizations. Dr. Heider has also built and designed NLP systems for start-ups and multi-national organizations that targeted live processing, reporting, and analysis on social and traditional media documents on the scale of tens of millions of documents a day. He received his PhD from the Linguistics Department at the State University of New York at Buffalo and his BA from Grinnell College.
